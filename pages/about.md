# Research Interests

I am interested in **neuroaesthetics** and questions related to the perception of beauty. I am highly motivated to observe neural networks and regions in the brain responsible for our aesthetic appeals, using **fMRI and EEG methods**. Additionally, I dive into how predictable our aesthetic appeals are, aiming to use machine learning and **deep neural networks** to predict the perception of beauty in the brain.
