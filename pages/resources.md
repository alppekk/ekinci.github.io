I am interested in Neuroaesthetics and following questions in the topic of perception of beauty. I am highly motivated to observer neural networks and regions in the brain responsible for our aesthetic appeals, so I use fMRI and EEG methods. I also dive into how predictiple our aesthetic appeals are, therefore; I also aim to use machine laerning and deep neural networks to predict the perception of beauty in the brain.
