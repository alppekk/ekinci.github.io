I am interested in neuroaesthetics and questions related to the perception of beauty. I am highly motivated to observe neural networks and regions in the brain responsible for our aesthetic appeals, using fMRI and EEG methods. Additionally, I dive into how predictable our aesthetic appeals are, aiming to use machine learning and deep neural networks to predict the perception of beauty in the brain.
