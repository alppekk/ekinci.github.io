# Research Projects

## Project 1: Neural Aesthetics and Machine Learning
**Description**: This project explores how neural networks in the brain are activated when people perceive beauty. Using machine learning, we aim to predict aesthetic responses through fMRI data.

## Project 2: EEG Responses to Aesthetic Stimuli
**Description**: In this research, I analyze EEG responses when participants view aesthetically appealing and unappealing images. We investigate whether neural patterns can distinguish aesthetic value.

## Project 3: Predicting Aesthetic Preferences with Deep Learning
**Description**: This project involves creating a deep learning model that predicts aesthetic preferences based on neural responses from fMRI data. Our goal is to make neural data-driven predictions on human aesthetic appeals.
