# Research Projects

## Project 1: Master's thesis - TrueSceneometry: FMRI Responses to True Scene Geometry
**Description**: This project explores how the brain processes motion signals and distinguishes between different types of motion: global motion (rigid) and local motion (nonrigid). We used ground-truth optical flow synthetic datasets to acquire precise measurements of motion and employed screen geometry to differentiate between camera motion (rigid) and object motion (nonrigid) in the movies. We collected fMRI data and used motion vectors as parameters to observe brain activation in response to these different motion types.

## Project 2: Bachelor's thesis - The Effects of Emotions on Visual Time Perception
**Description**: In this study we sought to explain the role of feeling ashamed in time perception. It was known that negative feelings make people overestimate time, however; the emotion shame was not studied in this context before.

## Project 3: Predicting Aesthetic Preferences with Deep Learning
**Description**: This project involves creating a deep learning model that predicts aesthetic preferences based on neural responses from fMRI data. Our goal is to make neural data-driven predictions on human aesthetic appeals.
