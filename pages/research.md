# Research Projects

## Project 1: Master's thesis - TrueSceneometry: FMRI Responses to True Scene Geometry
**Description**: This project explores how the brain processes motion signals and distinguishes between different types of motion: global motion (rigid) and local motion (nonrigid). We used ground-truth optical flow synthetic datasets to acquire precise measurements of motion and employed screen geometry to differentiate between camera motion (rigid) and object motion (nonrigid) in the movies. We collected fMRI data and used motion vectors as parameters to observe brain activation in response to these different motion types.

## Project 2: The Prediction Mechanisms Involved in Visual Motion Computation
**Description**: During stable eye position, the detectability of moving objects varies under two conditions: leading and trailing. This research investigates whether there are effects of motion direction and velocity on the prediction mechanisms for moving objects. We also introduced smooth pursuit eye movements to explore these effects further.

## Project 3: Bachelor's thesis - The Effects of Emotions on Visual Time Perception
**Description**: In this study we sought to explain the role of feeling ashamed in time perception. It was known that negative feelings make people overestimate time, however; the emotion shame was not studied in this context before.
