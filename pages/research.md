# Research Projects

## Project 1: Master's thesis - TrueSceneometry: FMRI Responses to True Scene Geometry
**Description**: This project explores how the brain processes motion signals and distinguishes between different types of motion: local motion (nonrigid) and global motion (rigid). We used ground-truth optical flow synthetic datasets to acquire precise measurements of motion and employed screen geometry to differentiate between camera motion and object motion in the movies. We collected fMRI data and used motion vectors as parameters to observe brain activation in response to these different motion types.

## Project 2: EEG Responses to Aesthetic Stimuli
**Description**: In this research, I analyze EEG responses when participants view aesthetically appealing and unappealing images. We investigate whether neural patterns can distinguish aesthetic value.

## Project 3: Predicting Aesthetic Preferences with Deep Learning
**Description**: This project involves creating a deep learning model that predicts aesthetic preferences based on neural responses from fMRI data. Our goal is to make neural data-driven predictions on human aesthetic appeals.
