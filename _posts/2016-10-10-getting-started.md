# The Neuroscience of Film

While humans watch movies, films gradually attract their attention and trigger perceptual, cognitive, and emotional processes in the human brain. Filmmakers use editing, montage, different camera movements and angles, etc., and all these techniques have different effects on the mind [^1].

FMRI offers a quantitative way to measure brain activation while participants freely watch movies to assess the aforementioned processes in the brain. Because fMRI data analysis is not suitable for free movie watching, inter-subject correlation (ISC), which measures similarity in activated brain regions across viewers who watch the same movie, offers a spatially and temporally high and reliable possibility. Hasson et al. (2004) [^2] were pioneers in the field by measuring brain activation during the free viewing of four different genre films. For example, the collective engagement power of a Hitchcock movie was greater than that of other less famous directors in the study because he evoked similar responses across all viewers in over 65 percent of the cortex. This demonstrates that Hitchcock was neuroscientifically able to master and manipulate viewersâ€™ minds, showcasing the uniqueness of his movies [^3].

The goal of the neuroscience of cinema is to explore the relationship between cognitive neuroscience and film. This field aims to provide useful neuroscientific evaluations of different types of filmmaking on the human brain and scientific methods for filmmakers to increase the quality of their products.
