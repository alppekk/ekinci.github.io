# The Neuroscience of Film

While humans watch movies, films gradually captivate their attention and activates perceptual, cognitive, and emotional processes in the human brain. Filmmakers use editing, montage, different camera movements and angles, etc., and all these techniques have different effects on the mind [^1].
<br>
<br>
The neuroscience of cinema seeks to explore the relationship between cognitive neuroscience and film. This field aims to provide valuable neuroscientific evaluations of different types of filmmaking on the human brain and scientific methods for filmmakers to enhance the quality of their products.
<br>
<br>
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a quantitative way to measure brain activation while participants freely watch movies to assess the aforementioned processes in the brain. Given that traditional fMRI data analysis is not well-suited for free movie viewing, inter-subject correlation (ISC) has emerged as a reliable method. ISC measures the similarity in brain activation across viewers watching the same film, offering both spatial and temporal precision.

Pioneering research by Hasson et al. (2004) [^2] measured brain activation during the free viewing of four different genre films. For example, the collective engagement power of a Hitchcock movie was greater than that of other less famous directors in the study because he evoked similar responses across all viewers in over 65 percent of the cortex. This demonstrates that Hitchcock was neuroscientifically able to captivate and manipulate viewersâ€™ minds, highligting the unique impact of his movies on the human brain [^3].
